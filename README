== IncludeByDefault

This plugin allows you to specify which associations should be eager-loaded automatically when you do a +find+ on one of your models. Read about eager loading in the Rails docs: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html

This saves you having to write <tt>:include</tt> all over the place to minimise your database queries. Instead, you can put whatever you'd usually specify using <tt>:include</tt> in one declaration in your model. Say you have a photoblog that allows comments. Then your entry model might look like this:

  class BlogEntry << ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :photos
    has_many :comments
    include_by_default :photos, :comments
  end

The associations will now be loaded automatically along with any <tt>BlogEntry</tt> record you +find+. If you specify <tt>:include</tt> explicitly in any +find+ operation, that will override the default specified in the model.


== Bugs

As well as the functionality stated above, IncludeByDefault attempts to fix a couple of bugs in ActiveRecord:

* http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/8838
* http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/8937

The first is a problem with cascaded many-to-many queries. e.g.

  Tag.find(8).entries.find(:all, :include => :tags)

will usually raise an exception. IncludeByDefault fixes this by catching such exceptions when they occur and rewriting the <tt>:include</tt> using the <tt>:joins</tt> option with numeric table aliases. It will do this for +has_and_belongs_to_many+ and <tt>has_many :through</tt> associations when they cause problems. It is a collosal hack but works as far as I can tell. If you're using some funny naming scheme on your associations it might not work. That said, this hack will only get fired if an initial SQL call raises a +StatementInvalid+ exception, where Rails on its own leaves you high and dry anyway.

The second is a problem that stops you using the <tt>:joins</tt> option on scoped many-to-many +find+ operations. That is, you cannot do

  Tag.find(8).entries.find(:all, :joins => sql_fragment)

if +Tag+ and +Entry+ are many-to-many. This plugin includes a rewrite of <tt>ActiveRecord::Base.add_joins!</tt> which allows you to do this as long as your <tt>:joins</tt> statement doesn't cause table naming conflicts with the scoped finder code. This was required in order to fix the first bug.
