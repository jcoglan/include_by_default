== IncludeByDefault

This plugin allows you to specify which associations should be eager-loaded automatically when you do a +find+ on one of your models. Read about eager loading in the Rails docs: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html

This saves you having to write <tt>:include</tt> all over the place to minimise your database queries. Instead, you can put whatever you'd usually specify using <tt>:include</tt> in one declaration in your model. Say you have a photoblog that allows comments. Then your entry model might look like this:

  class BlogEntry << ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :photos
    has_many :comments
    include_by_default :photos, :comments
  end

The associations will now be loaded automatically along with any <tt>BlogEntry</tt> record you +find+. If you specify <tt>:include</tt> explicitly in any +find+ operation, that will override the default specified in the model.
